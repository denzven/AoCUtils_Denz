### README.md

Hi! this is AoCUtilsDenz the short form of "Advent of Code Utilities by Denzven" its a small automation tool (in the making) to make it easier for ppl to solve the questions of AoC and organise and neaten up their code in the challenge.

for now, the code makes a boilerplate file system with all years ie,(2015 to 2020) and all days (Day0 - Day25) all the Day0 days are empty and are kept as a place holder:

the file tree system are as follows:

```html
D:.
|
\---AdventOfCode
    +---<year>
    |   +---<day>
    |   |       <day>Input.txt ()
    |   |       <day>Part1.py
    |   |       <day>Part2.py
    |   |       <day>Ques.txt
    |   |       README_<day>.md
    |   |
    |   \---<day>
    |	       <day>Input.txt
    |	       <day>Part1.py
    |	       <day>Part2.py
    |	       <day>Ques.txt
    |	       README_<day>.md
```
see the whole file system at [tree_fig.txt](https://github.com/denzven/AoCUtils_Denz/blob/main/tree_fig.txt)

this project is still in WIP and I have planned to add a lot more funtions and features to make solving these puzzles easier and not a headache in organising hundreds of files :)
